## Build and Push Multi-Arch Docker Image (`docker-multiarch-build.yml`) <a name="dockermultiarchbuild"/>

This reusable GitHub Actions workflow builds and pushes multi-arch Docker images (AMD64 and ARM64) to Docker Hub. It supports automatic version tagging for main branch pushes and PR-based temporary tagging.

### üîß Features / What it does?

- **Multi-arch build** using Docker Buildx and QEMU (supports `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`)
- **Automatic version bumping** (patch version) when pushing to the `main` branch
- **Pull Request builds** with temporary tags (e.g. `pr-123`)
- **Auto-deletes PR tags** on PR closure to keep your Docker Hub clean
- **Docker Hub login** support via secrets
